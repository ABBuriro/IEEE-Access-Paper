The code used to generate results presented in Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2021
The EEG was preprocessed in R and features were extracted using wavelet scattering transform in MATLAB.
The classifications were done in Google Colab using ThunderSVM and 1D CNN
Each script contains some description of the code
